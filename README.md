# cloudify
This script classifies clouds into 4 classes:
 'stratus', 'cirrus', 'cumulus', 'nimbus'
It uses TensorFlow's Estimator APIs.
It can be ran on Google's Colab machine/server
thus accessing the GPU or locally with a little bit directory pre-processing
and sorting. 
The training set is like 167 and testing set are 40.
This REPO is still under construction so WATCH your head #debris_falling!
